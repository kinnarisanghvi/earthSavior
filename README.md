# App name : Waste Watcher

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## What does the app do

Food loss and waste is a contributor to Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Our team and I brainstormed ways to allow university students to have information on the waste they produce on a daily basis, and encourage them to reduce it. We plan on including Image classification through CNN algorithm and transfer learning model to categorize the type of waste. We looked at various data sets relating to different types of waste (including of food, plastic, paper waste) and correlated the various carbon footprints associated with each of them. Based on this, we assigned scores for the user to understand their daily progress. We provide incentives to the users if they their sustainability role, they will be given points which can be redeemed at university stores.
